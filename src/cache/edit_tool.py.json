{"review": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to review this Python code based on the user's instructions. Let me start by looking at the code they provided. Hmm, wait, the user didn't actually include the code content. They just gave me placeholders like {filename} and {content}. That's a problem because without the actual code, I can't perform a meaningful review.\n\nI remember the user wants me to focus on specific categories: code quality, potential bugs, best practices, performance, and general improvements. Each point needs to be a bullet with an actionable suggestion and a code snippet. But without the code, I can't identify any issues or suggest improvements.\n\nMaybe the user forgot to include the code. I should let them know that I can't proceed without it. I'll ask them to provide the actual content of the file they want reviewed. That way, I can give them the detailed feedback they're expecting.\n\nI should keep my response polite and clear, making sure they understand that the code is necessary for me to help them effectively. I'll phrase it in a friendly manner so they don't feel discouraged from sharing the code.\n</think>\n\nI'm ready to review the code and provide actionable suggestions. Please provide the actual code content for the file you'd like reviewed."}
