## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, even if you're not a developer:

-   **Report Bugs**: If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub.
-   **Suggest Features**: Have an idea for a new feature or improvement? Open an issue to discuss it.
-   **Write Code**: Fix bugs, implement new features, or improve existing ones.
-   **Improve Documentation**: Help us make the `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and other documentation clearer and more comprehensive.
-   **Review Code**: Provide feedback on pull requests from other contributors.

## Getting Started with Code Contributions

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the `AI-Code-Reviewer` repository to your GitHub account.
2.  **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AI-Code-Reviewer.git
    cd AI-Code-Reviewer
    ```
3.  **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-new-llm`, `bugfix/fix-401-error`):
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-feature-branch-name
    ```
4.  **Set Up Your Development Environment**: Follow the instructions in the `README.md` to set up your local development environment, including installing dependencies and configuring environment variables.
5.  **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes, ensuring they adhere to the existing code style and conventions.
6.  **Test Your Changes**: Before submitting a pull request, thoroughly test your changes to ensure they work as expected and don't introduce new issues.
7.  **Commit Your Changes**: Write clear, concise commit messages. A good commit message explains *what* was changed and *why*.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add new LLM integration"
    ```
8.  **Push to Your Fork**: Push your new branch to your forked repository on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin your-feature-branch-name
    ```
9.  **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the original `AI-Code-Reviewer` repository on GitHub and open a new pull request from your branch. Provide a clear description of your changes and reference any related issues.
